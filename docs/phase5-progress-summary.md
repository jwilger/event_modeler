# Phase 5 Progress Summary

## Completed in PR #20

### âœ… Basic YAML Integration
- Successfully parsing example.eventmodel
- Converting YAML to domain model
- Generating EventModelDiagram from YAML

### âœ… Entity Type Classification
- Improved heuristics for inferring entity types from names
- Properly classifying views, events, commands, etc.
- Extracting top-level view names from view paths

### âœ… Basic Visual Rendering  
- Entity-type-specific colors (blue for commands/views, purple for events, etc.)
- Professional typography with type labels and entity names
- Larger entity boxes (160x80) for better readability
- SVG generation working end-to-end

### âœ… Circular Dependency Resolution (Temporary)
- Implemented conservative temporal filtering
- Only commandâ†’event and eventâ†’projection connections used for layout
- This avoids cycles but filters out many valid connections

## Discovered Issues

### ðŸš¨ Node-Based Layout Required
- Example.jpg shows entities appearing multiple times as separate nodes
- Current entity-based layout creates circular dependencies
- Need fundamental architecture change to support multiple visual nodes per entity

### Current Limitations
1. Many entity types filtered out of layout (views, queries, automations)
2. No data schema rendering (requires more space allocation)
3. No test scenario sub-diagrams
4. Missing many valid connections due to cycle avoidance

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete Current PR As-Is
- Mark PR #20 as ready with current functionality
- Document known limitations
- Create new PR for node-based layout implementation

### Option 2: Implement Node-Based Layout in Current PR
- Add DiagramNode types and generation
- Update layout engine to use nodes
- Complete all Phase 5 objectives in one PR

### Option 3: Split Into Multiple PRs
1. PR #20: Basic YAML rendering (current state) - merge this
2. PR #21: Node-based layout architecture 
3. PR #22: Rich content rendering (data schemas, test scenarios)

## Recommendation

I recommend **Option 1**: Complete PR #20 with current functionality. This provides:
- Working YAML to SVG pipeline
- Foundation for future improvements  
- Clear separation of concerns
- Ability to iterate on node-based layout without blocking basic functionality

The node-based layout is a significant architectural change that deserves its own focused implementation and testing.
