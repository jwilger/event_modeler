3. **Auto-close issue** - Closes issues when moved to Done
4. **Auto-add sub-issues to project** - Automatically adds sub-issues

### Recommended Additional Workflows

Configure these workflows in the GitHub UI (Settings ‚Üí Workflows):

1. **When issue assigned**

3. **Set Type for Epics**
   - Filter: Item has sub-issues
   - Action: Set Type to "üéØ Epic"

## MCP Integration

The MCP workflow server can interact with this project to:
- Query work priorities
- Update issue status
- Find next available work
- Track epic progress
- Generate reports

### Key GraphQL Queries

```graphql
# Get project items by priority
{
  node(id: "PROJECT_ID") {
    ... on ProjectV2 {
      items(first: 100, orderBy: {field: POSITION, direction: ASC}) {
        nodes {
          fieldValueByName(name: "Priority") {
            ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue {
              name
            }
          }
          content {
            ... on Issue {
              number
              title
              state
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Priority System

GitHub Projects uses **manual sort order** to determine priority:

### Epic Priority
- Epics are manually sorted in the "Epics Overview" view
- Top-to-bottom order = highest-to-lowest priority
- This determines which epic's work should be done first

### Sub-Issue Priority  
- Sub-issues are manually sorted within their Status column on the Kanban board
- When grouped by parent issue, the order within each group determines priority
- Top-to-bottom order = highest-to-lowest priority

### Work Selection Algorithm
1. Find the highest priority epic (by position in Epics view)
2. Within that epic, find the highest priority "Todo" sub-issue
3. Check that all dependencies are met
4. That's the next item to work on

The Priority field (P0-P3) is for additional context but **manual sort order is the source of truth**.

## Workflow Guidelines

1. **New Issues**: Default to "Todo" status
2. **Priority Management**: 
   - Drag epics in "Epics Overview" to set epic priority
   - Drag sub-issues within Status columns to set task priority
   - Use Priority field (P0-P3) for severity/urgency indicators
3. **Status Transitions**:
   - Todo ‚Üí In Progress (when assigned)
   - In Progress ‚Üí Done (when PR merged)
4. **Archival**: Done items auto-archive after 30 days
