# Event Modeler Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing the remaining functionality in Event Modeler while adhering to our type-driven development principles and architectural decisions.

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY FIRST STEP ðŸš¨

**ALWAYS create a todo list using TodoWrite as your VERY FIRST action when starting work.** This applies to:
- Starting a new work session
- Resuming work after a break
- Beginning implementation of any phase
- Even when you're just reviewing the plan

Your first todo item might simply be: "Review PLANNING.md to determine next tasks"

This ensures all work is tracked, organized, and nothing is missed.

## ðŸš¨ TRACKING TODO COMMENTS ðŸš¨

**CRITICAL**: When you discover work that needs to be done:
1. DO NOT just write TODO comments in code
2. IMMEDIATELY add the work item to PLANNING.md in the appropriate phase
3. Update your current TodoWrite list if the work affects the current phase
4. TODO comments are acceptable ONLY as temporary markers that are immediately tracked in PLANNING.md

This ensures no work is forgotten or lost in the codebase.

## Current Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-17

| Phase | Branch | Status | PR # | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| CLI Foundation | `feature/cli-foundation` | Complete | #4 (merged) | CLI args parsing, main entry point, e2e test framework |
| Text Parsing | `feature/text-parsing` | Complete | #6 (merged) | Lexer and parser implementation with comprehensive tests |
| Layout Engine | `feature/layout-engine` | Complete | #7 (merged) | Swimlane/entity positioning, connector routing foundation |
| SVG Rendering | `feature/svg-rendering` | In Progress | #8 (draft) | SVG rendering with theme support |
| Integration | `feature/integration-polish` | Not Started | - | - |

**Current Focus**: SVG Rendering implementation in progress. Basic SVG structure, swimlanes, entities, connectors, and theme support implemented. Continue with Phase 4 completion.

## Overview

**CRITICAL**: The VERY FIRST step when starting any work session is to create a todo list using the TodoWrite tool. Even if the only item is "Review PLANNING.md to determine next tasks", you MUST create this todo list before doing anything else. This ensures work is always tracked and organized.

The implementation will follow a PR-driven workflow with feature branch chaining:
1. Create a feature branch for each phase
2. Implement the feature with acceptance tests
3. Create a PR with auto-merge enabled
4. Branch the next feature off the previous feature branch
5. Monitor PR status and fix any CI failures
6. Handle rebasing when base branches are merged

## Implementation Phases

### Branch Structure Plan

The implementation will create these feature branches in sequence:
1. `feature/cli-foundation` - CLI argument parsing and basic structure
2. `feature/text-parsing` - Lexer and parser implementation  
3. `feature/layout-engine` - Layout computation algorithm
4. `feature/svg-rendering` - SVG generation from layout
5. `feature/integration-polish` - Final integration and polish

Each branch builds on the previous one, creating a chain of PRs.

### Phase 1: CLI Foundation & Basic E2E Test

**Branch**: `feature/cli-foundation`  
**Base**: `main`

**Goal**: Create a minimal working CLI that can process a simple .eventmodel file and produce SVG output.

#### 1.1 Create End-to-End Acceptance Test
```bash
tests/e2e/basic_conversion.rs
```
- Create a simple test .eventmodel file
- Run the CLI with this file
- Verify SVG output is created
- This test will initially fail but guide our implementation

#### 1.2 Implement CLI Argument Parsing
- Implement `src/cli.rs` functions:
  - `Cli::from_args()` - Parse command line arguments
  - `Cli::execute()` - Orchestrate the conversion process
- Preserve existing type signatures using `TypedPath<F,P,E>`
- No runtime validation - all validation through type parsing

#### 1.3 Implement Main Entry Point
- Replace `todo!()` in `src/main.rs`
- Wire up CLI to parse args and execute
- Handle errors gracefully with proper exit codes

**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- CLI can be invoked with `cargo run -- input.eventmodel -o output.svg`
- Proper error messages for invalid arguments
- Help text displays correctly
- PLANNING.md updated with completion status

### Phase 2: Text Parsing Implementation

**Branch**: `feature/text-parsing`  
**Base**: `feature/cli-foundation`

**Goal**: Parse .eventmodel files into our strongly-typed domain model.

#### 2.1 Create Parser Test Suite
```bash
tests/parsing/
â”œâ”€â”€ lexer_tests.rs      # Token generation tests
â”œâ”€â”€ parser_tests.rs     # AST construction tests
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/           # Test .eventmodel files
```

#### 2.2 Implement Lexer
- Implement in `src/infrastructure/parsing/lexer.rs`:
  - `Lexer::new()` - Initialize lexer with input
  - `Lexer::next_token()` - Generate tokens from input
- Use the existing `Token` enum without modification
- Ensure position tracking for error messages

#### 2.3 Implement Parser with Typestate Pattern
- Implement in `src/infrastructure/parsing/mod.rs`:
  - `EventModelParser::parse_header()` - Parse title section
  - `EventModelParser::parse_body()` - Parse swimlanes
  - `EventModelParser::build()` - Construct final AST
- Follow the typestate pattern: `Empty -> HasHeader -> HasBody -> Complete`
- Use existing domain types from `src/event_model/entities.rs`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Can parse valid .eventmodel files without panics
- Invalid files produce clear error messages with line numbers
- Parser enforces correct section ordering at compile time
- PLANNING.md updated with completion status

### Phase 3: Layout Engine Implementation

**Branch**: `feature/layout-engine`  
**Base**: `feature/text-parsing`

**Goal**: Compute positions for all diagram elements.

#### 3.1 Create Layout Test Suite
```bash
tests/layout/
â”œâ”€â”€ positioning_tests.rs  # Element positioning
â”œâ”€â”€ sizing_tests.rs      # Size calculations
â””â”€â”€ constraints_tests.rs # Layout constraints
```

#### 3.2 Implement Layout Algorithm
- Implement in `src/diagram/layout.rs`:
  - `LayoutEngine::compute_layout()` - Main layout computation
  - Calculate swimlane positions
  - Position entities within swimlanes
  - Route connectors between entities
- Use existing `LayoutConfig` and dimension types
- Ensure all positions use validated numeric types

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Elements positioned without overlaps
- Connectors route cleanly between entities
- Layout respects configured spacing and margins
- PLANNING.md updated with completion status

### Phase 4: SVG Rendering Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

**Branch**: `feature/svg-rendering`  
**Base**: `feature/layout-engine`

**Goal**: Generate valid SVG output from layout data.

#### 4.1 Create Rendering Test Suite
```bash
tests/rendering/
â”œâ”€â”€ svg_output_tests.rs   # SVG structure tests
â”œâ”€â”€ theme_tests.rs        # Theme application tests
â””â”€â”€ expected/             # Expected SVG outputs
```

#### 4.2 Implement SVG Generation
- Implement in `src/diagram/svg.rs`:
  - `SvgRenderer::render()` - Generate complete SVG
  - Render swimlanes with labels
  - Render entities with appropriate shapes and styles based on their type (wireframe, command, event, projection, query, automation)
    - **TODO from code**: Determine entity type and use appropriate style (currently all entities use command style)
  - Render connectors with arrows
  - Serialize SVG document to valid XML output
- Use the strongly-typed SVG element builders
- Apply theme styles from `src/diagram/theme.rs` with correct style per entity type

#### 4.3 Outstanding Implementation
**TODO items found in codebase that need completion in this phase:**
- `src/infrastructure/parsing/lexer.rs`: Implement `Lexer::new()` and `next_token()` methods (should have been Phase 2)
- `src/infrastructure/parsing/mod.rs`: Implement parser methods (should have been Phase 2)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Generated SVG is valid XML âœ…
- All elements properly styled according to theme âœ…
- SVG renders correctly in browsers âœ…
- PLANNING.md updated with completion status âœ…

**Completion Summary**:
- Implemented entity type detection via EntityType enum and registry lookup
- Implemented SVG serialization (SvgDocument::to_xml() method)
- Added comprehensive SVG serialization tests
- Wired up full pipeline from .eventmodel input to SVG output
- Verified pipeline with test.eventmodel file
- Note: Full layout computation and ParsedEventModel to EventModelDiagram conversion deferred to Phase 5

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish

**Branch**: `feature/integration-polish`  
**Base**: `feature/svg-rendering`

**Goal**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly.

#### 5.1 Integration Testing
- Create comprehensive integration tests
- Test various .eventmodel file formats
- Verify error handling across the pipeline
- Test both light and dark themes

#### 5.2 Documentation Generation
- Ensure all public items have rustdoc comments
- Run `cargo doc` to verify documentation builds
- Update README with usage examples

#### 5.3 Outstanding Implementation
**TODO items found in codebase that need completion:**
- `src/diagram/layout.rs`: Add connectors to EventModelDiagram and use them in layout computation
- `src/infrastructure/types.rs`: Implement `NonEmpty::first()`, `last()`, and `get()` methods
- `src/export/pdf.rs`: Implement PDF export functionality (PdfExporter methods)
- `src/export/markdown.rs`: Implement Markdown export functionality (MarkdownExporter methods)
- `src/main.rs`: Complete CLI integration with all export formats

## Testing Strategy

Following our type-driven testing ADR:

1. **Minimal Runtime Tests**: Only test behaviors that can't be encoded in types:
   - Parsing logic (lexer and parser)
   - SVG output format
   - File I/O operations

2. **No Tests for Type-Guaranteed Behavior**:
   - Don't test that NonEmptyString is non-empty
   - Don't test that validated paths exist
   - Don't test typestate transitions

3. **Property-Based Tests** (if needed):
   - For layout algorithm invariants
   - For parser robustness

## Important: Todo List Management

**CRITICAL**: When using the TodoWrite tool to track implementation progress:

1. **EVERY OTHER TASK** in your todo list must be:
   - "Run the build (cargo build) and tests (cargo test --workspace), and if everything passes (except e2e tests), commit changes and push"
   
2. The **LAST item** on EVERY todo list must always be:
   - "Review PLANNING.md, update with current status, determine next tasks, and START implementing them"

### Example Todo List Structure:
1. Implement CLI argument parsing in src/cli.rs
2. Run build and tests; commit and push if passing (first push creates upstream branch)
3. Create draft PR immediately after first push
4. Implement main entry point in src/main.rs  
5. Run build and tests; commit and push if passing
6. Add error handling for invalid arguments
7. Run build and tests; commit and push if passing
8. Review PLANNING.md, update with current status, determine next tasks, and START implementing them

This ensures:
1. **Extremely frequent verification** that code compiles and tests pass
2. **Incremental commits** capturing each small working change
3. **Early detection** of any breaking changes
4. **Clean commit history** with each commit representing buildable code
5. **Early PR creation** for visibility and CI feedback
6. The plan stays current with actual progress
7. No steps are missed within or between phases
8. **Continuous forward momentum** - work continues seamlessly without stopping
9. Clear handoff between work sessions
10. **No pause between phases** - as soon as one phase is complete, the next begins immediately

**Note**: Build and test checks should happen AT LEAST this frequently, if not more often. You may add additional build/test/commit steps between tasks whenever it makes sense.

## PR-Driven Development Workflow

### For Each Feature Implementation:

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   - First feature: `git checkout -b feature/cli-foundation`
   - Subsequent features: `git checkout -b feature/<name> feature/<previous-feature>`
   - This creates a chain: main â†’ cli-foundation â†’ parsing â†’ layout â†’ svg-rendering

2. **Implement Feature**
   - Write acceptance test first
   - Fill in `todo!()` placeholders
   - Preserve all type signatures
   - Run quality checks:
     ```bash
     cargo fmt --all
     cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
     cargo test --workspace
     ```

3. **Incremental Commits and Pushes**
   - **Commit extremely frequently**: Follow the todo list pattern where every other task is "Run build and tests; commit and push if passing"
   - This means committing after EVERY small implementation task that builds successfully
   - Write descriptive commit messages (no prefixes) explaining the "why"
   - Example commit points:
     - After implementing a single function that compiles
     - After adding a new test that passes
     - After fixing a compiler error
     - After any refactoring that maintains working code
     - After adding a type definition
     - After implementing any todo!() placeholder
   - First push: `git push -u origin feature/<name>`
   - Subsequent pushes: `git push`
   - **Remember**: The todo list structure enforces this frequency - every implementation task is followed by a build/test/commit task

4. **Create Draft Pull Request (IMMEDIATELY after first push)**
   - **CRITICAL**: This must be the VERY NEXT task in your todo list after the first push
   - Creating the draft PR early ensures visibility and CI feedback throughout development
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --draft \
     --title "Implement <feature description>" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   - <what this PR implements>
   - <key changes made>
   
   ## Test Plan
   - [ ] Acceptance tests pass
   - [ ] cargo clippy shows no warnings
   - [ ] cargo fmt has been run
   
   ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code
   EOF
   )" \
     --base <previous-feature-branch-or-main>
   ```

5. **Continue Development**
   - Keep making incremental commits as you implement
   - Push regularly to update the draft PR
   - Each push updates the PR with your latest changes

6. **Mark PR Ready and Enable Auto-Merge (when feature complete)**
   ```bash
   # Mark as ready for review
   gh pr ready <PR-number>
   
   # Enable auto-merge
   gh pr merge <PR-number> --auto --squash
   ```

7. **Start Next Feature**
   - Immediately branch off current feature branch
   - Continue implementation while previous PR runs CI

### PR Monitoring Tasks

**Check periodically throughout implementation:**

1. **Check PR Status**
   ```bash
   gh pr list --author @me
   gh pr checks <PR-number>
   ```

2. **Fix Failed Checks**
   - If a PR has failing checks:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/<failing-branch>
     # Fix the issues
     git add -A && git commit -m "Fix CI failures"
     git push
     ```

3. **Handle Base Branch Updates**
   - If base branch has new commits:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/<current>
     git fetch origin
     git rebase origin/feature/<base-branch>
     git push --force-with-lease
     ```

4. **Rebase Orphaned Branches**
   - When a base branch PR merges, downstream PRs need rebasing:
     ```bash
     # Check if base branch still exists
     gh pr view <PR-number> --json baseRefName
     
     # If base branch is gone (merged), rebase onto main
     git checkout feature/<orphaned-branch>
     git fetch origin
     git rebase origin/main
     git push --force-with-lease
     
     # Update PR base branch
     gh pr edit <PR-number> --base main
     ```

### Branch Chain Example

```
main
 â””â”€â”€ feature/cli-foundation (PR #1)
      â””â”€â”€ feature/text-parsing (PR #2)
           â””â”€â”€ feature/layout-engine (PR #3)
                â””â”€â”€ feature/svg-rendering (PR #4)
```

As PRs merge:
1. PR #1 merges â†’ PR #2 needs rebase to main
2. PR #2 merges â†’ PR #3 needs rebase to main
3. And so on...

## Type System Considerations

Throughout implementation:

1. **Parse, Don't Validate**:
   - All validation at system boundaries
   - Return `Result<ValidType, ParseError>`
   - Never use `.unwrap()` or `.expect()`

2. **Leverage Existing Types**:
   - Use `NonEmptyString` for required strings
   - Use `TypedPath<F,P,E>` for file paths
   - Use validated numeric types for dimensions

3. **Maintain Type Safety**:
   - Don't bypass type constraints
   - If tempted to use `unsafe`, reconsider design
   - Let the compiler guide correct implementation

## Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:

1. All `todo!()` placeholders are replaced
2. Can convert .eventmodel files to SVG/PDF
3. All tests pass (minimal but comprehensive)
4. No clippy warnings
5. All public items documented
6. CI pipeline passes

## PR Monitoring Checklist

Throughout the implementation, regularly check:

1. **Every 30 minutes during active development:**
   ```bash
   # Check all open PRs
   gh pr list --author @me
   
   # Check specific PR status
   gh pr checks <PR-number>
   ```

2. **When switching between features:**
   - Ensure previous PR is green and auto-merge is enabled
   - Check if any base branches have been merged
   - Rebase if necessary

3. **Before starting new work each day:**
   - Review all open PRs
   - Check for any failed CI runs
   - Handle any necessary rebases

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1 (CLI): 2-3 hours
- Phase 2 (Parsing): 4-6 hours  
- Phase 3 (Layout): 3-4 hours
- Phase 4 (SVG): 3-4 hours
- Phase 5 (Integration): 2 hours

Total: ~14-19 hours of implementation

**Note**: Additional time may be needed for:
- Fixing CI failures
- Rebasing branches as PRs merge
- Addressing any review feedback (though with auto-merge, this should be minimal)

## Notes

- Performance is explicitly not a priority (per ADR)
- Focus on correctness through types
- Maintain the philosophy: "Parse, don't validate"
- When in doubt, encode constraints in types rather than tests

## Summary of PR Workflow

1. **Start**: Branch from main for first feature
2. **Chain**: Each subsequent feature branches from previous
3. **First Push**: Create draft PR immediately
4. **Develop**: Make frequent commits and pushes as you build
5. **Complete**: Mark PR ready and enable auto-merge when done
6. **Monitor**: Check PR status regularly
7. **Fix**: Address any CI failures on their branch
8. **Rebase**: When base branches merge, rebase downstream PRs
9. **Continue**: Keep working while PRs process in parallel

This approach allows continuous progress while maintaining clean history and ensuring each feature builds properly on its dependencies.

## Implementation Checklist

When implementing each phase:
- [ ] Create feature branch from correct base
- [ ] Write acceptance tests first
- [ ] Make first commit once tests compile (even if failing)
- [ ] Push branch with first commit
- [ ] **Create draft PR immediately after first push**
- [ ] Implement functionality preserving type signatures
- [ ] Follow the todo list pattern: every implementation task followed by build/test/commit task
- [ ] Commit after each small buildable change:
  - [ ] After implementing each function
  - [ ] After fixing compilation errors
  - [ ] After adding/updating tests
  - [ ] After adding type definitions
  - [ ] After implementing any todo!() placeholder
  - [ ] Push commits regularly to update draft PR
- [ ] Run cargo fmt, clippy, and tests before marking PR ready
- [ ] Mark PR as ready for review when feature complete
- [ ] Enable auto-merge on PR
- [ ] Update PLANNING.md status table
- [ ] Start next phase by branching from current

**Remember**: 
- Every other task in your todo list must be "Run build and tests; commit and push if passing"
- The first push must be immediately followed by creating a draft PR
- The last todo item in every TodoWrite list must be "Review PLANNING.md, update with current status, determine next tasks, and START implementing them"
- Claude should continue working until ALL phases in PLANNING.md are complete - the last todo ensures continuous progress
